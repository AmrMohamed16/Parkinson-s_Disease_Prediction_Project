# Brief

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is crucial for timely intervention and management. This project aims to provide a reliable tool for predicting the presence of Parkinson's disease using voice recordings.



# Tools & Libraries

I.	VSCode(IDE)

II.	Python 3.x

III. numpy

IV. pandas 

V.  scikit-learn

VI.	 tkinter




# Remarks

* This python program was run and tested on the VSCode[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

* Ensure the required libraries are installed by running:
  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
